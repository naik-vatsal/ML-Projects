## About Me
I'm a passionate AI & Machine Learning engineer with experience in developing LLM-powered applications, knowledge graphs, and agentic AI workflows. My work spans various domains, including semantic search, high-performance computing, and AI-driven automation.

## Skills & Technologies
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **LLMs & NLP:** Hugging Face, OpenAI API, GPT, BERT, T5
- **Knowledge Representation:** Neo4j, RDF, SPARQL, OWL, AWS Neptune
- **Vector Search & RAG:** FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate
- **Agentic AI & Automation:** LangChain, Semantic Kernel, Kubernetes

## Projects
### 1. Multi-Modal AI Assistant *(Ongoing)*
-	Architected a multi-modal AI assistant capable of processing 10K+ text and audio inputs weekly, delivering context-aware, tailored responses that improved user engagement
-	Fine-tuned NLP models on domain-specific datasets (e.g., CUAD) using TensorFlow, achieving 95% accuracy in key clause extraction and summarization
-	Deployed the system as a scalable REST API using FastAPI and Docker, and hosted it on AWS for seamless integration into existing workflows

### 2. LLM-Powered Semantic Search Engine *(Planned)*
- Building an LLM-powered search engine that leverages knowledge graphs and embeddings to improve search relevance by 40%.
- Designing an efficient vector search system using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings, optimizing document retrieval speed.
- Implementing context-aware search ranking algorithms to enhance user query resolution accuracy.

### 3. Agentic AI Workflow Automation *(Planned)*
- Developing AI-driven automated workflows for knowledge discovery and reasoning, integrating LLMs with symbolic AI techniques.
- Building intelligent query routing and response generation pipelines, increasing data processing efficiency by 50%.
- Deploying RAG-based AI systems for real-time industrial applications.

## Next Steps
This repository will be updated with code, documentation, and research as I progress on these projects. Stay tuned!
